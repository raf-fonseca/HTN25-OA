# HTN25-OA

This boilerplate contains a Flask + Graphene install with SQLite for GraphQL
endpoints. The current directory is mounted as a volume under `/home/api` so
that you do not have to rebuild the image every time. Building and running the
image will start the Flask server on port 3000.

Good luck!
